# cubeExploder
## _ka-boom!!_

Pretty much every single Blender tutorial I have ever watched begins with the instructor deleting the default cube. I mean,
almost every single one!! So why do we have this default? Why not a default with no cube?

This just makes me laugh. And then it hit me - - - rather than a simple _Select All_ > _x_ > _delete_, what is really called for is 

BLOWING THIS SHIT UP. 

I mean, seriously folks. The cube MUST go ***KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!***

And so, cubeExploder was born.

There is something strangely satisfying about this. Press the big button and enjoy. It's not quite ASMR but there is 
something similar I can't quite put my finger on.

Anyway I hope you enjoy this free add-on, complete with three explosions included for your exploding pleasure. I have
been thinking about making more extreme explosions in future versions, maybe a Monty Python foot stomping it to a pancake, or perhaps
the default cube being washed away in a massive tsunami. I dunno. Do you have ideas? Send me them!

Or better yet - send me your own cube destruction! If you send as a geometry node or some other procedural list that I can throw
into the add-on python codebase, and you meet cubeExploder's High Standards For Excellence, I will give you full credit, thanks,
and you will be revered and appreciated by future cube exploder-ers worldwide, the envy of millions.

Enjoy
