# cubeExploder
## _ka-boom!!_

Pretty much every single Blender tutorial I have ever watched begins with the instructor deleting the default cube. I mean,
almost every. single. one. So why do we even have this default cube to begin with? Why not a default scene setup with no cube?

This just makes me laugh. And then it hit me - - - rather than a simple _Select All_ > _x_ > _delete_, what is really called for is 

BLOWING THIS SHIT UP. 

I mean, seriously folks. The cube MUST go ***KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!***

And so, cubeExploder was born.

There is something strangely satisfying about this. Download the zip file to install this add-on into your Viewport N-panel, press the Big Button, and you will immediately know what I mean. It's not quite ASMR but there is 
something similar about this that I can't quite put my finger on.

But regardless. PRESS THE BIG BUTTON! You will see. 

Anyway I hope you enjoy this free add-on, complete with three explosions included in the Advanced Settings for your exploding pleasure. I have
been thinking about making more Extreme explosions in future versions, maybe a Monty Python foot stomping it to a pancake, or perhaps
the default cube being washed away in a massive tsunami? I dunno. Do you have ideas? Send me them!

Or better yet - if you are so bold and skilled - send me your own cube destruction! If you send to me as a geometry node or some other procedural list
that I can throw into the add-on python codebase _(and if you meet cubeExploder's High Standards For Excellence)_, I will gladly give you full credit,
a personal email of thanks, and you will be revered and appreciated by future cube exploder-ers worldwide, the envy of millions. Maybe someday we
will even have cubeExploder stickers that proudly proclaim "I am a Cube Exploder!"  Yay!  :D

Enjoy
